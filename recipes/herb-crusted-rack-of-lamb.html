    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lamb rack is one of those things that always seems fancy, but the truth is that it's actually so easy, and hard to mess up. This version is super simple and classic. The timing in the recipe yields pink, juicy, medium-rare meat, but you can of course cook it longer/to a higher temperature if preferred. Perfect for your Easter lunch, or as an impressive part of any special occasion meal.</p>
